# A PROGRAM SYNTHESIZER BASED ON NUMERICAL INPUT-OUTPUT EXAMPLES
Since the birth of the first electronic computer, computer programs have helped us
accomplished all kinds of hard and difficult tasks, leaving us only convenience. Nevertheless, the
coding work always puzzles many programmers. We hope that computers could help us generate
programs automatically, setting us free from the boring coding work. Program synthesis may help
us realize that dream. It also does very good job in the discovery of new algorithm, auto-solving,
intelligent torturing and so on. Moreover basing on the input-output examples is the most natural
and simplest form to present user intents. I made a simple PROGRAM SYNTHESIZER BASED
ON NUMERICAL INPUT-OUTPUT EXAMPLES by the language of C++. It contains two
engines, one of which is a synthesis engine using the program synthesis technique, which can
discover the regular pattern between the terms; the other is especially used for calculate the
General Term of the polynomial expression. The former is the focus of my work, and the latter is
only for reference and comparison. When applied to the numerical reasoning problems of the
Civil Service Examinations, it works quite well and is able to solve most of them. This paper
illustrates the details of my realization of the PROGRAM SYNTHESIZER BASED ON
NUMERICAL INPUT-OUTPUT EXAMPLES, the related techniques, the problems encountered
and solutions to them.
